    "Our ability to resolve detail in astronomical observations is limited by the diffaction of light in our telescopes.  Light from stars can be treated effectively as coming from an infinitely far away point source. When this light, with wavelength $\\lambda$, passes through the circular aperture of a telescope (which we'll assume to have unit radius) and is focused by the telescope in the focal plane, it produces not a single dot, but a circular diffraction patter consisting of a central spot surrounded by a series of concentric rings. The intensity of the light in this diffraction pattern is given by\n",
